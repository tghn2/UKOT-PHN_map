### UI.r file ###
Create shinyapp map input in shinyapp UI file
# Maximum is 900px, 100% width of column for responsive design - smallest size most likely 300px
Load map as image
### Some example code to manipulate
### leaflet() %>%
###   setView(-0.1354223, 51.5135085, zoom = 17) %>%
###   addTiles(urlTemplate = "http://walkerke.github.io/tiles/snow/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
###            attribution = 'Data source: <a href="http://guides.library.yale.edu/gisworkshoparchive">Yale ### University Library</a>', 
###            options = tileOptions(minZoom = 15, maxZoom = 18, tms = TRUE)) %>%
###   addCircles(data = deathsxy, 
###              radius = deathsxy$Num_Cases, 
###              popup = circle_popup, 
###              color = "red", 
###              fillColor = "red")

### var map = L.map('map', {
###  crs: L.CRS.Simple, // CRS.Simple, which represents a square grid:
###  minZoom: -2,
###  maxZoom: 1
### })

leaflet() %>%
setView(,,zoom = 2) %>%
addTiles(urlTemplate = "https://github.com/carolinajane/UKOT-PHN_maptiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
        attribution = 'Data source: IMPROPER Design Agency for UKOT-PHN',
        options = tileOptions(minZoom = 0, maxZoom = 6, tms = TRUE)) %>%
addCircles(data = ,
            radius = ,
            popup = circle_popup,
            color = "E40046",
            fillColor = "E40046")
             
Leaflet.TileLayer.IIP - need to check to see if this works with R
Zoom default at 50%
Image full size: width = 8000, height = 4500
# Need to append to map tile loading script?
0% zoom = match frame size
50% zoom = half full image size
100% zoom = full image size
Load canvas layer for circles/markers
Locations for Territory markers - co-ordinates??
Load pop up information

Data groups
Location and Geography
Population - pie charts by percentage

### Server.r file ###
Output/"back" information needs to go in the server file
# Need data of UKOT territories from the documents sent to me by Brittney. Unsure of what table layout to use... Will need to experiment.

Interactivity
Tracking: mouse movement
Event: mouse hoover over circle, circle highlighted
pop-up, Event: mouse click on circle, small pop up with country name and location co-ordinates

Event: mouse click on cross on small pop, closes pop up - close blind pop up?
Event: mouse click on read more in pop up - pop up closes, right hand side panel appears
Event: mouse click on cross on side panel, side panel closes
Event: mouse click on panel and then scroll bar, scroll in side panel moves
Event: mouse click outside of map, scroll bar moves main page
Event: mouse hoover over link in pop-up, link becomes high-lighted
Event: mouse click on pop-up, read more - open side pane with all information, opacity of map reduces to 50%
Event: mouse click and hold on map, move map
Event: mouse click on zoom bar, adjusts zoom level of map
Event: mouse click on top of zoom bar or plus sign, zoom level 100%
Event: mouse click on bottom of zoom bar or minus sign, zoom level 0%
